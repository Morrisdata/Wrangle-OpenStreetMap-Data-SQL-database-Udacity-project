# Wrangle-OpenStreetMap-Data-SQL-database-Udacity-project

This project, I used data wrangling techniques to clean Houston, Texas map area from openstreetmap data. The reason to choose this city is because it is my current city and I got my master degree in this city. Cleaned data in XML is converted to CSV and imported into a SQL database.
